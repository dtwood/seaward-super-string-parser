Seaward Super String parser
===========================

This is a draft parser for the `.sss` file format, used by Seaward's Apollo
series of PAT testers.

I developed it using sample export of ~1000 PAT records, created using an
[Apollo 400]
(http://www.seaward.co.uk/products/portable-appliance-testing-equipment/pat-tester-kits/apollo-400)
tester, so it may not work for files generated by other machines (and probably
doesn't work for most files generated by that machine).
